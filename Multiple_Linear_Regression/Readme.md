Multiple-Linear-Regression

A very simple python program to implement Multiple Linear Regression using the LinearRegression class from sklearn.linear_model library. 

Consider following dataset
 
Tank temperature (degrees Fahrenheit) -> x1	
Petrol temperature (degrees Fahrenheit)	-> x2
Initial tank pressure (pounds/square inch)-> x3	
Petrol pressure (pounds/square inch) -> x4
Hydrocarbons escaping (grams)  -> y
